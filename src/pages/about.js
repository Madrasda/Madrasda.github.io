            <p className='italic'>Madras da for Production House</p>
            <br />
            Movie merchandise has been a significant part of the film industry
            for decades. It's an excellent way for production companies to
            extend their brand and make additional revenue from their movies. In
            this blog, we'll discuss movie merchandise, the benefits of selling
            it, and how much money production companies can make by selling it.
            <br />
            <br />
            Movie merchandise refers to any product that has been produced as a
            result of a film, such as action figures, t-shirts, posters, and
            other memorabilia. It's a great way for fans to connect with their
            favorite movies and characters beyond the film itself.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the primary benefits of selling movie merchandise is that it
            can generate significant additional revenue for production
            companies. According to a report by the Licensing Industry
            Merchandisers Association (LIMA), licensed merchandise sales in
            North America alone reached $29.6 billion in 2019. This figure
            includes all forms of licensed merchandise, including those not
            related to movies, but it's still an indication of how much money
            can be made from merchandise sales.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <p className='italic'>Traditional Way</p>
            <br />
            When a production company licenses its intellectual property to a
            merchandising partner, it earns a percentage of the revenue
            generated from the sale of merchandise. This percentage can vary,
            but it's typically around 10-15% of the wholesale price of the
            product. So, if a t-shirt sells for $20, and the production
            company's percentage is 10%, they would earn $2 from each sale.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <p className='italic'>What makes MADRAS DA unique</p>
            <br />
            We have meticulously crafted a distinct dashboard for Production
            Houses, facilitating them to set their own margin with absolute
            transparency across all aspects.
            <br />
            <br />
            To provide an illustration, if the base product value is 199, you
            have the freedom to set the MRP at 399.
            <br />
            <br />
            This empowers the Production Houses to earn a direct margin without
            the involvement of any intermediary, thereby ensuring maximum
            profitability.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the event of 1000 products being sold, with an average margin of
            200 rupees per product, the Production House stands to earn a
            substantial sum of 2 lakh rupees.
            <br />
            <br />
            The amount of money a production company can make from movie
            merchandise sales depends on several factors, such as the popularity
            of the movie, the types of products being sold, and the marketing
            efforts put into promoting the merchandise.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, the Star Wars franchise is one of the most successful
            movie merchandise franchises of all time. According to a report by
            Statista, licensed merchandise sales for Star Wars reached $3.3
            billion in 2019. This includes everything from action figures to
            clothing to video games.
            <br />
            <br />
            Other successful movie merchandise franchises include Marvel
            Cinematic Universe, Harry Potter, and Disney's animated movies.
            These franchises have generated billions of dollars in merchandise
            sales over the years.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            In conclusion, movie merchandise is an excellent way for production
            companies to extend their brand and make additional revenue from
            their movies. The amount of money that can be made from merchandise
            sales depends on several factors, but it's clear that successful
            franchises can generate billions of dollars in revenue. If you're a
            movie fan, buying merchandise can be a great way to show your
            support for your favorite films and characters while also
            contributing to the movie industry's success.
